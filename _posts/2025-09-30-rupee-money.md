Today there is a digital as well as paper form of currency exchange that people call money. Money is controlled by the government. All money has either originated from a Goverment Bank like RBI (Reserve Bank of India) or being gathered from a foreign Goverment Bank via Wire Transfers. In essence for the Indian context, money is generated by the government.
