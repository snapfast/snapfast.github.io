### Breathing and Sinus

Breathing is you. Mind and Body are extensions of your breath. If you stop breathing, mind and body does not exist anymore.
Using water (distilled water) to clear up the sinus. Even drinking water from the Nasel cavity is recommended. Best liquid for cleaning sinus is our own urine.

### Hands and Heart

Hands are the extension of the heart. Therefore, hands function as the pump for the blood. Yes, pumping hands can increase blood flow. It can cause for the Urine to become darken.
The actual difference occurs in the kidneys which start pushing the dirt out of the system. The best exercise for getting best effects is clapping. Longer and harder you clap, better cleaning of the lymphatic system happens. After clapping hold your hands together for atleast 10 minutes in Namaste position.
