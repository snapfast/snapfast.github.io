> creates empty feeling, keep doing anyway, eating right, behaving right,
> new horizon appears, very brilliant personality appears

Feeling of giving up is because you still have bad qualities. Eat light, and keep moving. Activity keeps the energy flow. We are spiritual beings, we need the energy flowing. So keep moving, everyday.


# Animal is the Bottom Cause

By Animal eating, we seek drugs, we seek sugar to make your inside better.

- Make us aggressive
- One eats meat, 5 more people add up.

## So, what is the cause which makes people seek animal food ?

Last 60 years, tremendous increase in animal food demand.

# Couples that stay together

1. Easy to Communicate / Talk, Expressive and Relaxed (Jolly)
2. Trust (No suspicion, No doubt) - Know well
3. Common Dream - Same Direction (Goal is same)
4. Sharing Different areas - uniqueness
5. Health
6. Economically - One (Joint Accounts) - Wise man makes his wife / girlfriend take care.

Trust on yourself, and trust on her.
