Time is valuable, when time is lost only regret remains

Do not let the body rest more than 4 hours, in less than 40 years of age

Eating less, do not let people know that you did not eat the food

Do not sleep in the day

Your body should obey your decisions, it should always follow your commands

Be stubborn, extrememly subborn

Say Ishwar naam continuously, regardless of the activity

Young force in your body is very important

24 hours only need 400 grams of food, eat very calculated, even less, best health

Nobody can trap you into the lies, most of them are telling lies

Practice the awake body and active body 

Do not stop until you see the Ishwar 

Reject Relaxation

Reject Comfort

Reject Modernity
